# U2.W4: Homework Cheater


# I worked on this challenge by myself.

# 2. Pseudocode

# Input: a title, topic, date, thesis_statement
# Output: an essay
# Steps:
# define essay_writer method that takes a title, topic, date, gender, and thesis_statement as an argument.
# use an if else statement to determing gender.
# write a template to store new variables.
#
# 3. Initial Solution

def essay_writer (title, topic, date, gender,thesis_statement)
  if gender == "female"
  	puts "#{title}
  	 #{topic} is a super important woman in hip-hop history. In #{date}, she #{thesis_statement}. #{topic} contributed greatly 
  	 to hip-hop music and her influence continues today."
  elsif gender == "male"
    puts "#{title}
  	 #{topic} is a super important man in hip-hop history. In #{date}, he #{thesis_statement}. #{topic} contributed greatly 
  	 to hip-hop music and his influence continues today."
  else 
  	puts "no gender defined"
  end
end

# 4. Refactored Solution

# I actually think my initial code is pretty concise and DRY.
#
#
#
#

# 1. DRIVER TESTS GO BELOW THIS LINE
puts essay_writer("My super fresh hip-hop history essay", "Queen Latifah", "1995", "won a Grammy for Best Rap Solo Performance for her song, 'UNITY.'")
puts essay_writer("My super fresh hip-hop history essay", "Kurtis Blow", "1980", "released his record 'The Breaks' that went on to sell more than a million copies.")
puts essay_writer("My super fresh hip-hop history essay", "Missy Elliott", "1997", "released her first album, 'Supa Dupa Fly.' She would eventually become the highest selling female rapper of all time.")







# 5. Reflection 
# I really liked this challenge. I felt like I grasped the concepts pretty easily and didn't have trouble figuring out
# what to do. I feel confident with the concepts and am gettig more comfortable working with if else, elsif statements and
# string interpolation.
