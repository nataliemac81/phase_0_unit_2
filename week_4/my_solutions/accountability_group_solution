# U2.W4: Accountability Group Creator!


# I worked on this challenge by myself.

# 2. Pseudocode

# Input: an array of names
# Output: the array of names divided into groups of 4 members per group.
# Steps:
# define method called group_maker
# group_maker should take an array called fireflies as an argument.
# shuffle the array using the shuffle method.
# use the slice method to divide the array into groups of 4.
# put the result in a variable called result_arrays.
# return the output of result_arrays.


# 3. Initial Solution:

fireflies = ["Keenan Turner", "Caleb Rugg", "Lana Rakhman", "Ahmed Al-Bahar", "Zac Mitton", "Peter Debelak", "Tyler Keating", "Daniel Yoachim", 
"Mikee Pourhadi", "Carl Krause", "Mike Daugherty", "Catherine Farkas", "Scott Silveus", "Brendan Brown", "Rick Dsida", 
"Xander Glassman", "Kim Girard",  "Travis Hernandez", "Natalie McCroy", "Natalie Frecka"]

def group_maker(fireflies)
	result_arrays = fireflies.shuffle.each.slice(4).to_a
end
	return result_arrays
end




# 4. Refactored Solution

# I feel like the initial code is as far as I could get---I know that it's not correct, but I couldn't quite figure out where to go next.
#
#
#



# 1. DRIVER TESTS GO BELOW THIS LINE
if defined?(group_maker) == "method"
  puts "true"
else
  puts "method not defined"
end

if group_maker(fireflies).parameters? == "array"
  puts "true"
else
  puts "group_maker does not contain an array"
end

if fireflies.include?("Keenan Turner", "Caleb Rugg", "Lana Rakhman", "Ahmed Al-Bahar", "Zac Mitton", "Peter Debelak", "Tyler Keating", "Daniel Yoachim", 
"Mikee Pourhadi", "Carl Krause", "Mike Daugherty", "Catherine Farkas", "Scott Silveus", "Brendan Brown", "Rick Dsida", 
"Xander Glassman", "Kim Girard",  "Travis Hernandez", "Natalie McCroy", "Natalie Frecka")
  puts "true"
else
  puts "fireflies does not include those names"
end

if result_arrays(num) {|num| num > 4}
  puts "result_arrays has more than 4 members"
elsif unit_1.length(num) {|num| num < 4}
  puts "result_arrays has less than 4 members"
else 
  puts "result_arrays has 4 members"
end

if result_arrays.equal?
  puts "groups are the same"
else 
  puts "groups are equal"
end






# 5. Reflection 
# This challenge was TOUGH for me! I'm still not sure where I went wrong...but I went terribly wrong. Lol. I don't know...I had moments where
# I was sure I was on the right track and then I got confused again. I was a little thrown off by the challenge instructions I think. I wasn't
# quite sure what was expected of us and maybe it was just a bit to open ended for me in this point in my learning when I still feel so
# unsure of many of the concepts.
