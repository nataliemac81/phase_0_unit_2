 U2.W4: Title here


# I worked on this challenge by myself.

# 2. Pseudocode

# Input: an integer.
# Output: comma separated integer as a string.
# Steps:
# define a method called separate_comma that takes an integer as an argument.
# define an array called array_of_integers and turn it into a string and split digits into separate strings.
# if the length of array_of_integers is greater than or equal to 7 insert commas at position -7 and -4.
# else if array_of_integers is greater than or equal to 4 insert comma at -4.
# join elements in array_of integers into a single string.


# 3. Initial Solution

def separate_comma (n)
  array_of_integers = n.to_s.split('')
  length = array_of_integers.length

  if length >= 7
    array_of_integers.insert(-7, ",")
    array_of_integers.insert(-4, ",")
  elsif length >= 4
    array_of_integers.insert(-4, ",")        
  end
  array_of_integers.join
end





# 4. Refactored Solution
# I'd like to figure out how to use something besides an if else statement in this case. Honestly, it was just
# easier. I think if I used a block it would be cleaner and more readable. I'll practice this next week.
